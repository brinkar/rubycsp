= SCP library in Ruby

A VERY infant library introducing SCP-like concurrent programming to the Ruby world.

*Importing:* Borderline totally unusable. Still lacks a lot of very basic SCP concepts. Primarily used as a platform for learning CSP while taking the Extreme Multiprogramming course at the University of Copenhagen.

Note: Currently only works in Ruby 1.9 due to some unexpected behaviour in 1.8 thread primitives.
